# Forking 

Mixlayer allows you to "fork" sequences, which means you can create independent child sequences from the context in a single parent sequence. 

Building up context in a sequence can be expensive. Forking allows you to reuse that state and explore multiple different future paths from that common context. 

## Basics 

In this example, we'll populate a sequence with some instructions then create several forks of it. In each fork we'll give it further instructions and then concurrently generate responses from each child sequence.

<Callout type="info">
  It's important to close forks when you're done with them. The `withFork` method closes the child automatically when the closure exits.
</Callout>

```typescript file=fork.ts
const seq = await socket.open("meta/llama3.1-8b-instruct-free");

// populate parent sequence with a question
await seq.append("What's the meaning of life?", { role: "user" });

// in each child, ask the model to answer in a different language
const [spanish, chinese, pirate] = await Promise.all([ 
  seq.withFork((s) => { 
    s.append("Please answer in Spanish.\n", { role: "user" });
    return s.gen({ role: "assistant" }).text(); 
  }),
  seq.withFork((s) => { 
    s.append("Please answer in Chinese.\n", { role: "user" });
    return s.gen({ role: "assistant" }).text(); 
  }),
  seq.withFork((s) => { 
    s.append("Please answer like a pirate.\n", { role: "user" });
    return s.gen({ role: "assistant" }).text(); 
  }),
]);

console.log("Spanish: ", spanish);
console.log("Chinese: ", chinese);
console.log("Pirate: ", pirate);
```

### Limits

Limits on the number of concurrent forks you have vary based on your account's limits. If you exceed this limit, the platform will throw an error.
