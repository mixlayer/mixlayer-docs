# Pricing 

Mixlayer is a hybrid GPU compute and inference platform and is priced differently from other AI platforms. We price our models based on GPU usage as well as number of tokens processed.

See the [Models](https://console.mixlayer.com/app/models) section of the console for a list of available models and their pricing.

### Custom and Fine-tuned Models

We can host custom, fine-tuned and distilled models for you. [Get in touch](mailto:hello@mixlayer.com) with us to learn more.
