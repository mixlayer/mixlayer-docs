# Introduction
 
Welcome to Mixlayer! 

### What is this?

Mixlayer is a platform that enables you to build, deploy, and manage customized versions of AI models. It is designed to be easy to use, and to allow you to focus on building your models, rather than managing infrastructure.

Programmable model logic. 
Gives you access to models that are more programmable, more flexible.
No calling rest APIs.  No managing state. 

### Why is it useful?

Stateful fluid control, deployment.

### How does it work? 

We compile your scripts to WASM and run them inside of our custom AI infrastructure.
