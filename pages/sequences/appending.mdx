# Appending Tokens

To prompt a model, you can use the `append` operation to place tokens in its context window: 

```typescript file=append.ts
await seq.append("The meaning of life is");

const response = await seq.gen().text(); // generate a completion

console.log(response);
```

## Roles

For instruction-tuned models, you can also specify the role of the tokens you'd like to append: 

```typescript file=append-role.ts
// append a system prompt
await seq.append("You are a buddhist monk that deeply ponders existential questions.", 
    { role: "system" });

// append a question as a user
await seq.append("What's the meaning of life?", 
    { role: "user" });

// generate a response
const response = await seq.gen({ role: "assistant" }).text(); 

console.log(response);
```
