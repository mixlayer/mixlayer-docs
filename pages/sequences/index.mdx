# Opening a Sequence

Sequences ("seqs" for short) are the primary way to interact with models on Mixlayer. They are created by using the `open` operation. 

```typescript file=open.ts
const seq = await socket.open("meta/llama3.1-8b-instruct-free");

// do things with seq...
```

When you're done with a seq, be sure to close it using the `close` operation to stop being billed for compute resources. 

```typescript file=close.ts
await seq.close();
```
