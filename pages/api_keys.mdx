# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Mixlayer API. You can create an API key in the [Mixlayer console](https://console.mixlayer.com/app/api-keys).

Select `+ New Key` to create a new API key. Once the key is created, be sure to save it somewhere safe. You will not be able to access it again after you leave the page. We are unable to recover your key if you lose it.
