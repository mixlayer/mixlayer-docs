# Quickstart

This guide will help you get started with Mixlayer and ModelSocket's Typescript SDK (our protocol for statefully interacting with LLMs). If you prefer not to use ModelSocket, you can use  Mixlayer's OpenAI-compatible REST API instead. 

To complete this quickstart, you'll need to have a basic understanding of Javascript and know how to run commands in your terminal.

<Steps>
### Create an account
 
If you haven't already, create and sign-in to a Mixlayer account. You can sign up at [console.mixlayer.com/sign-up](https://console.mixlayer.com/sign-up). 
 
### Get an API Key

An API key will allow you to make requests to Mixlayer's models. Once you have a key, set it to an environment variable so the library can access it. 

```bash filename="env.sh" copy
export MODELSOCKET_API_KEY=sk_********
```

### Setup your project

Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm and the ModelSocket SDK. 

```bash filename="init.sh" copy
mkdir mixlayer-quickstart
cd mixlayer-quickstart
npm init -y
npm install modelsocket
```

### Create a script 

Create a new file called `script.mjs`. 

<Callout type="info">
  Be sure to use the `.mjs` extension or else the script won't be able to import other modules.
</Callout>

Use `ModelSocket.connect` to open a connection. Then use  `open`, `append` and `gen` crate sequences and interact with them.

```js filename="script.mjs" copy
import { ModelSocket } from "modelsocket";

const socket = await ModelSocket.connect("wss://models.mixlayer.ai/ws");

try {
  // allocate sequence on a gpu for llama 8b
  const seq = await socket.open("meta/llama3.1-8b-instruct-free");

  // append a prompt to its context window
  await seq.append("Explain quantum computing.\n", { role: "user" });

  // generate a response
  const stream = seq.gen({ role: "assistant" }).textStream();

  // print the response as it generates
  for await (const chunk of stream) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
} finally {
  // be sure to close the socket to release any resources
  socket.close();
}
```

### Run your script

Run your script with `node script.mjs`.

```bash filename="run.sh" copy
node script.mjs
```

You should see the output stream to your terminal: 

```output.txt
> node script.mjs
**Introduction to Quantum Computing**

Quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and operations on data. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or...
```

Congratulations! You've just made your first request to Mixlayer.

### Next Steps

* Appending a `system` prompt at the beginning to customize the output and personality of the model to your liking 
* Deploy your code behind an API so you can use it in your own apps
* Give the model access to tools to exhance its capabilities
* Integrate additional models like a guard model to protect against unauthorized uses
