# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with Mixlayer by guiding a model to provide simple horoscopes and then deploying it to an API. 

<Steps>
### Create an account
 
If you haven't already, create and sign-in to a Mixlayer account. You can sign up at [console.mixlayer.com/sign-up](https://console.mixlayer.com/sign-up). 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We require a credit card number to sign up for an account. However, we provide a starter model free of charge. You will not be charged unless you use the paid  models in the playground or in an app.
