# JSON Output

Mixlayer models can return JSON output using one of several methods. 

One way to accomplish this is to generate the fields of the JSON object separately as hidden tokens and then combine them into a single object using `JSON.stringify`: 

```js filename="rpg-character.js" copy
// accept the character's name as a request parameter
const name = request.params.name || "Fiona"; 
const classes = ["Mage", "Warrior", "Ninja", "Barbarian", "Paladin"]; 

prompt(`Let's create an RPG character named  ${name}.\n`, {hidden: true, role: 'user'});

prompt(`What character class should our character be?\n`, { hidden: true, role: 'user' }); 
const clazz = gen({regex: classes.join('|'), hidden: true, stop_at: '\n', role: 'assistant'}); 

prompt(`\nWrite a visual description of this character.\n`, { hidden: true, role: 'user' });
const description = gen({len: 1000, hidden: true, stop_at: '\n', role: 'assistant'}); 

prompt(`\nWrite an origin story for this character.\n`, { hidden: true, role: 'user' });
const origin_story = gen({len: 1000, hidden: true, stop_at: '\n', role: 'assistant'}); 

prompt('\nWhat level is this character?\n', { hidden: true, role: 'user' }); 
const level = parseInt(gen({regex: '[1-9][0-9]*', hidden: true, role: 'assistant'}));

let json_obj = { 
    name, 
    clazz, 
    description,
    origin_story, 
    level
}; 

prompt(`\n${JSON.stringify(json_obj, null, 2)}`);
```

```json filename="output.txt"
{
  "name": "Fiona",
  "clazz": "Ninja",
  "description": "Fiona stands at about 5'8\" with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of training in the art of ninjutsu. Her short, spiky hair is a dark brown color that's often styled in a messy, piecey look, with a few stray strands framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are an piercing emerald green, a trait she inherited from her mother, and seem to gleam with a mischievous intensity.",
  "origin_story": "Fiona was born in the hidden village of Akakawa, nestled deep within the mountains of feudal Japan. Her parents, Kaito and Emiko, were both skilled ninjas who had dedicated their lives to protecting their village from external threats.",
  "level": 5
}
