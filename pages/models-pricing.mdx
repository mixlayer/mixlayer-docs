# Models & Pricing 

Mixlayer is priced differently from other AI platforms. We charge you based on your code's execution time rather than on the number of tokens used or requests you make.

See the Models section of the console for a list of available models and their pricing.

### Custom and Fine-tuned Models

We can host custom, fine-tuned and distilled models for you. [Get in touch](mailto:hello@mixlayer.com) with us to learn more.
