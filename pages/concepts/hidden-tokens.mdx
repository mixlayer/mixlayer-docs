# Hidden Tokens

When your model generates text, much of the time a lot of its output is not necessary to display in the final result. For example, you might walk the model through a set of reasoning steps to arrive at a conclusion, but only want to show the final answer. Most models also require certain "system" tokens to be generated to produce an optimal outut and it's useful to hide those as well.

To accomplish this, Mixlayer allows you to mark certain tokens as "hidden" so they are not displayed in the final output. 

## How it works

When you call `gen` or `prompt` with the `hidden` option set to `true`, the text generated by the model will not be visible in the output by default.

In the Playground of the Console, you can toggle the visibility of hidden tokens by clicking the Slashed Eye button in the top right corner of the pane.
